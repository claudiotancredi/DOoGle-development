# Usability Testing SCRIPT

## Welcome and purpose of the Test

Hi **[participant]**. My name is **[facilitator]**, and I am a part of the DOoGle team from the Human Computer Interaction course at Politecnico di Torino.  
First of all, I want to thank you for participating in this study. I understand your time is valuable, so I assure you this won't take too much of it and hopefully you will
find this experience enjoyable. 

What we are going to do today is performing a Usability Testing on a mobile application prototype, DOoGle, that we developed during the course. This app gives dog owners valuable help in taking care of their pet. We would like to ask you to help us by giving us your impressions about the app. We are going to ask you to complete a series of tasks that match goals typical users, like yourself, might have when using this application. We are interested in knowing how you do things, where you look, things like that. More than what you’re doing, though, we’re interested in knowing what you’re thinking, how you react to things on the application.

Please, for the entire duration of the session always remember that what we are testing in this session is strictly our application, not your performance during the usage. Any error that may happen is the application's fault, not yours.

## Describe the think-aloud methodology

One important thing we need you to keep in mind while you are testing is that, for some of the tasks, we need you to “think out loud". This means that, while you are performing a task, we need you to describe what you are doing and why, what you think is happening and so on. Anything you may think when using this app during the test, we need you to say it out loud.

This really helps us understand what is going through your mind while you are using the app. If you like it, we want to know that, if you get frustrated or are
confused, we want to know that too.  
We want to know what you think of your experience when using the app, whether positive or negative. There are no wrong answers in this study. 
I can show you a little example of how to apply this methodology.

Do you have any questions? 

## Provide the informed consent form for participation

Before we start with the Usability Testing itself, we need to let you read and complete a form. This will acknowledge that you are informed about all that is going to happen during this test, and also give us permission to take pictures and record the session for further usage and improvements of our application.

> Give the participant the Informed Consent form to compile

Thank you very much, now we can proceed with the last instructions about the session and then we can start!

## Explain the testing process

This Usability Test will be run in this way: you will be given a set of tasks and, for each task, we will observe you reaching the goal. For some tasks, we will give you a short questionnaire about the task itself and for some others you will apply the think-aloud methodology that I just explained you before. 

Let's start.

## Start the Test tasks

> Start the session recording

Imagine that you have just arrived at home from the shelter with your new dog friend and, since you never owned a dog before, you need some help about the first things to do and know. You have found the DOoGle app in the previous days and you want to try it!

### Task #1

The first thing you think about is what food to give to your dog. You imagine that kibble may be a good choice, so you can check for information about kibble inside the DOoGle app.  

You first task is to _read information about kibble in the DOoGle app._

### Task #2

The application description said that the DOoGle app provides a Guide and a Forum about many possible topics. Maybe you may find some more information about kibble in the Forum!

Now, you should _read related forum posts after reading about Kibble._
> Provide the SEQ questionnaire

### Task #3

Another important thing to have for your dog is without doubts some toys. You may find some useful advices given by expert users to learn more about the possible toys to give to your friend. This task requires you to apply the think-aloud methodology that I explained you before.

The next task is to _find some useful advices about toys given by expert users._
> Provide the SEQ questionnaire

### Task #4

You have used the DOoGle app for a while now, and you found some of the posts on the Forum very useful! You may thank the authors of some of those posts by leaving a like and a comment.

You now need to _leave a like and a comment to the toy-advice post you appreciated the most._

### Task #5
You found a forum post that you think may be useful for the next time you spend time with your dog, so you want to keep it accessible for when you need it. 
You should _save as favorite the post you liked the most and visualize it in your favorite posts._ This task requires you to apply the think-aloud methodology.

> Provide the SEQ questionnaire

### Task #6

Today was a great day! You spent some wonderful time with your dog and want to share this experience with others in the DOoGle app, so that they may read about it.
Try to _publish a forum post about some meaningful experience you had with your dog and tag it accordingly._ This task requires you to apply the think-aloud methodology.

> Provide the SEQ questionnaire


### Task #7

You change idea about your post that you just created, edit it.

You want to _edit the post that you created in the forum._

### Task #8

You need to find information about a specific topic on the Forum, but the tags alone do not seem to help. Maybe trying to find a specific word can help.

Try to _find a forum post containing a specific word._

## Post-test questionnaire and final greetings

Thank you, you have now gone through all the tasks in our Usability Testing. We remind you again that everything we have measured and evaluated during this session was about the application, not about yourself.  

We now ask you to complete a final questionnaire, which will tell us how you perceived the usability of our application (if it was easy to use, hard, enjoyable and so on...).
>Provide the SUS questionnaire to the participant

Perfect! We are at the end of the Usability Testing session. Thank you again for your time and the big help that you gave us with your participation.  
To thank you, I offer you **[something]**! Goodbye!!
> Offer the participant a coffee/dog treats/something
